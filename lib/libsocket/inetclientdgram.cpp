/*
 * DESCRIPTION FOR INETCLIENTDGRAM.CPP
 * 	This file provides the class inet_dgram_client which is used
 * 	for internet domain UDP client sockets. You think, in UDP
 * 	there is no difference between client and server? This is
 * 	correct, but in libsocket, the difference is that the UDP
 * 	client sockets may be connected and are not explicitly
 * 	bound to somewhere.
